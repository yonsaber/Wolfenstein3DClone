######AKA: A criticism of the [3D Engine](https://github.com/yonsaber/3DGameEngine)


####BIG ISSUES:
* RENDERING ENGINE

####Smaller Issues:
* Some way to insert game into engine
* Better scratchpad support
* Better textures (reading, blitting, basic image processing)
* Some way to seperate game and engine data
* Add higher level rendering constructs (Shaders, Materials, Meshes, Transform)
* Add some form of auto shader selection
* Add some form of primitives (Rectanges, Spheres)
* More flexible transform class
* Non perspecive views (Orthogonal views)
* Texture manipulation (Translation, Rotation, Scale)
*
